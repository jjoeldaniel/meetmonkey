# MeetMonkey

> Welcome to the jungle

Do you ever feel like dating is a jungle out there? Well, with MeetMonkey, we've made it a little more literal. Here at MeetMonkey, we believe that finding your perfect match should be as fun and easy as swinging from branch to branch.
How it works

We've taken inspiration from our primate cousins and created a dating app that's as easy as peeling a banana. Simply create a profile, upload a photo of yourself (no monkey suits, please), and start browsing other monkey singles in your area.

When you find someone who catches your eye (or your tail), send them a banana emoji to break the ice. If they respond positively, it's time to get chatty and start arranging a date.

## Safety first

At MeetMonkey, we take safety seriously. That's why we've implemented some special features to keep you and your new monkey friends safe. We've added a scratch-and-sniff feature to make sure everyone smells like a real monkey, and we've also partnered with local zoos to verify the identities of our members.
Get started today!

So what are you waiting for? Whether you're a capuchin looking for love or a macaque on the hunt for a mate, MeetMonkey is the perfect place to find your soul-mate. So come join the fun and start swinging towards love today!
